about my ML program:

This is my Machine Learning explanation about motorcyle. The machine learning program predicts motorcycle prices using features like brand, engine size, model year, and mileage. A small dataset was created first. It included various motorcycles along with their actual market prices. The brand data, being text, got converted to numerical form through one-hot encoding. This allowed the model to process it properly. Data preparation came next. The dataset split into training and testing sets. This setup helped measure the model's learning effectiveness.

Linear Regression served as the chosen algorithm. It works simply and effectively for continuous values such as price. Training happened on the training data. Evaluation followed with metrics like Mean Absolute Error and R squared score. These checked the accuracy levels. A graph plotted actual versus predicted prices. It visualized performance clearly. The trained model then predicted a new motorcycle's price from its features. In the end, the program shows machine learning's application in estimating motorcycle prices with basic data.
